     * **IMPORTANT**:
     * - This is a legacy method to ease the migration from `mxGraph`. Use the {@link insertVertex} method with a single object parameter instead.
     * - If the position of the vertex is not set at vertex creation (by setting the `x` and `y` parameters), it is advised to use a {@link GraphLayout} or a {@link LayoutManager} to automatically compute the actual position.
     * - If the size of the vertex is not set at vertex creation (by setting the `width` and the `height` parameters), it is advised to later set the size on the geometry of the vertex instance.
     * Otherwise, the vertex has no size and it is not displayed.
     *
     * When adding new vertices from a mouse event, one should take into
     * account the offset of the graph container and the scale and translation
     * of the view in order to find the correct unscaled, untranslated

     *

     * style: {
