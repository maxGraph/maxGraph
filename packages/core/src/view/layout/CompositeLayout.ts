/**
 * Allows to compose multiple layouts into a single layout.
 *
 * The {@link master} layout is the layout that handles move operations if another layout than the first
 * element in {@link GraphLayout}s should be used. The {@link master} layout is not executed as
 * the code assumes that it is part of {@link layouts}.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```javascript
 * const first = new FastOrganicLayout(graph);
 * const second = new ParallelEdgeLayout(graph);
 * const layout = new CompositeLayout(graph, [first, second], first);
 * layout.execute(graph.getDefaultParent());
 * ```
 *
 * Constructs a new layout using the given layouts. The graph instance is
 * required for creating the transaction that contains all layouts.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *
 * graph - Reference to the enclosing {@link Graph}.
 * layouts - Array of {@link GraphLayout}s.
 * master - Optional layout that handles moves. If no layout is given then
 * the first layout of the above array is used to handle moves.
