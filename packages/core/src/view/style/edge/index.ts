/**
 * Provides various edge styles to be used as the values for `edgeStyle` in a cell style.
 *
 * The following example sets the default edge style to `ElbowConnector`:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const style = stylesheet.getDefaultEdgeStyle();
 * style.edgeStyle = EdgeStyle.ElbowConnector;
 * ```
 *
 * To write a custom edge style, create a function as follows.
 * In the example below, a right angle is created using a point on the horizontal center of the target vertex and the vertical center of the source vertex.
 * The code checks if that point intersects the source vertex and makes the edge straight if it does.
 * The point is then added into the result array, which acts as the return value of the function.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const MyStyle = (state, source, target, points, result) => {
 *   if (source && target) {
 *     const pt = new Point(target.getCenterX(), source.getCenterY());
 *
 *     if (mathUtils.contains(source, pt.x, pt.y)) {
 *       pt.y = source.y + source.height;
 *     }
 *
 *     result.push(pt);
 *   }
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * The new edge style can then be registered in the {@link StyleRegistry} as follows:
 * ```javascript
 * StyleRegistry.putValue('myEdgeStyle', MyStyle);
 * ```
 *
 * The custom edge style above can now be used in a specific edge as follows:
 * ```javascript
 * style.edgeStyle = 'myEdgeStyle';
 * ```
 *
 * The key of the {@link StyleRegistry} entry for the function should be used in the {@link CellState.edgeStyle} values, unless {@link GraphView.allowEval} is `true.
 * In this case, you can also use the `'MyStyle'` string for the value in the cell style above.
 *
 * The custom EdgeStyle can be used for all edges in the graph as follows:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const style = graph.getStylesheet().getDefaultEdgeStyle();
 * style.edgeStyle = MyStyle;
 * ```
 *
 * It can also be used directly when setting the value of the `edgeStyle` key in a style of a specific edge as follows:
 * ```javascript
 * style.edgeStyle = MyStyle;
 * ```
 *
