/**
 * Extends {@link EventSource} to implement an application wrapper for a graph that
 * adds {@link actions}, I/O using {@link Codec}, auto-layout using {@link LayoutManager},
 * command history using {@link undoManager}, and standard dialogs and widgets, e.g.
 * properties, help, outline, toolbar, and popupmenu. It also adds {@link templates}
 * to be used as cells in toolbars, auto-validation using the {@link installChangeHandler}
 * flag, attribute cycling using {@link cycleAttributeValues}, higher-level events
 * such as {@link root}, and backend integration using <urlPost> and {@link urlImage}.
 *
 * ### Actions
 *
 * Actions are functions stored in the <actions> array under their names. The
 * functions take the {@link Editor} as the first, and an optional {@link Cell} as the
 * second argument and are invoked using <execute>. Any additional arguments
 * passed to execute are passed on to the action as-is.
 *
 * A list of built-in actions is available in the <addActions> description.
 *
 * ### Read/write Diagrams
 *
 * To read a diagram from an XML string, for example from a text field within the
 * page, the following code is used:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const doc = xmlUtils.parseXML(xmlString);
 * const node = doc.documentElement;
 * editor.readGraphModel(node);
 * ```
 *
 * For reading a diagram from a remote location, use the {@link open} method.
 *
 * To save diagrams in XML on a server, you can set the {@link urlPost} variable.
 * This variable will be used in {@link getUrlPost} to construct a URL for the post
 * request that is issued in the {@link save} method. The post request contains the
 * XML representation of the diagram as returned by {@link writeGraphModel} in the
 * xml parameter.
 *
 * On the server side, the post request is processed using standard
 * technologies such as Java Servlets, CGI, .NET or ASP.
 *
 * Here are some examples of processing a post request in various languages.
 *
 * - Java: URLDecoder.decode(request.getParameter("xml"), "UTF-8").replace("
", "&#xa;")
 *
 * Note that the linefeed should only be replaced if the XML is
 * processed in Java, for example when creating an image, but not
 * if the XML is passed back to the client-side.
 *
 * - .NET: HttpUtility.UrlDecode(context.Request.Params["xml"])
 * - PHP: urldecode($_POST["xml"])
 *
 * ### Creating images
 *
 * A backend (Java, PHP or C#) is required for creating images. The
 * distribution contains an example for each backend (ImageHandler.java,
 * ImageHandler.cs and graph.php). More information about using a backend
 * to create images can be found in the readme.html files. Note that the
 * preview is implemented using VML/SVG in the browser and does not require
 * a backend. The backend is only required to creates images (bitmaps).
 *
 * ### Special characters
 *
 * Note There are five characters that should always appear in XML content as
 * escapes, so that they do not interact with the syntax of the markup. These
 * are part of the language for all documents based on XML and for HTML.
 *
 * - &lt; (<)
 * - &gt; (>)
 * - &amp; (&)
 * - &quot; (")
 * - &apos; (')
 *
 * Although it is part of the XML language, &apos; is not defined in HTML.
 * For this reason the XHTML specification recommends instead the use of
 * &#39; if text may be passed to an HTML user agent.
 *
 * If you are having problems with special characters on the server-side then
 * you may want to try the {@link escapePostData} flag.
 *
 * For converting decimal escape sequences inside strings, a user has provided us with the following function:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * function html2js(text) {
 *   const entitySearch = /&#[0-9]+;/;
 *   let entity;
 *
 *   while (entity = entitySearch.exec(text)) {
 *     const charCode = entity[0].substring(2, entity[0].length -1);
 *     text = text.substring(0, entity.index)
 *            + String.fromCharCode(charCode)
 *            + text.substring(entity.index + entity[0].length);
 *   }
 *
 *   return text;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Otherwise, try using hex escape sequences and the built-in unescape function for converting such strings.
 *
 * ### Local Files
 *
 * For saving and opening local files, no standardized method exists that
 * works across all browsers. The recommended way of dealing with local files
 * is to create a backend that streams the XML data back to the browser (echo)
 * as an attachment so that a Save-dialog is displayed on the client-side and
 * the file can be saved to the local disk.
 *
 * For example, in PHP the code that does this looks as follows.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * $xml = stripslashes($_POST["xml"]);
 * header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"diagram.xml\"");
 * echo($xml);
 * ```
 *
 * To open a local file, the file should be uploaded via a form in the browser
 * and then opened from the server in the editor.
 *
 * ### Cell Properties
 *
 * The properties displayed in the properties dialog are the attributes and
 * values of the cell's user object, which is an XML node. The XML node is
 * defined in the templates section of the config file.
 *
 * The templates are stored in {@link Editor.templates} and contain cells which
 * are cloned at insertion time to create new vertices by use of drag and
 * drop from the toolbar. Each entry in the toolbar for adding a new vertex
 * must refer to an existing template.
 *
 * In the following example, the task node is a business object and only the
 * Cell node and its Geometry child contain graph information:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <Task label="Task" description="">
 *   <Cell vertex="true">
 *     <Geometry as="geometry" width="72" height="32"/>
 *   </Cell>
 * </Task>
 * ```
 *
 * The idea is that the XML representation is inverse from the in-memory
 * representation: The outer XML node is the user object and the inner node is
 * the cell. This means the user object of the cell is the Task node with no
 * children for the above example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <Task label="Task" description=""/>
 * ```
 *
 * The Task node can have any tag name, attributes and child nodes. The
 * {@link Codec} will use the XML hierarchy as the user object, while removing the
 * "known annotations", such as the Cell node. At save-time the cell data
 * will be "merged" back into the user object. The user object is only modified
 * via the properties dialog during the lifecycle of the cell.
 *
 * In the default implementation of {@link createProperties}, the user object's
 * attributes are put into a form for editing. Attributes are changed using
 * the {@link CellAttributeChange} action in the model. The dialog can be replaced
 * by overriding the {@link createProperties} hook or by replacing the showProperties
 * action in {@link action}. Alternatively, the entry in the config file's popupmenu
 * section can be modified to invoke a different action.
 *
 * If you want to display the properties dialog on a double click, you can set
 * {@link Editor.dblClickAction} to showProperties as follows:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * editor.dblClickAction = 'showProperties';
 * ```
 *
 * ### Popupmenu and Toolbar
 *
 * The toolbar and popupmenu are typically configured using the respective
 * sections in the config file, that is, the popupmenu is defined as follows:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <Editor>
 *   <EditorPopupMenu as="popupHandler">
 * 		<add as="cut" action="cut" icon="images/cut.gif"/>
 *      ...
 * ```
 *
 * New entries can be added to the toolbar by inserting an add-node into the
 * above configuration. Existing entries may be removed and changed by
 * modifying or removing the respective entries in the configuration.
 * The configuration is read by the {@link EditorPopupMenuCodec}, the format of the
 * configuration is explained in {@link EditorPopupMenu.decode}.
 *
 * The toolbar is defined in the EditorToolbar section. Items can be added
 * and removed in this section.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <Editor>
 *   <EditorToolbar>
 *     <add as="save" action="save" icon="images/save.gif"/>
 *     <add as="Swimlane" template="swimlane" icon="images/swimlane.gif"/>
 *     ...
 * ```
 *
 * The format of the configuration is described in {@link EditorToolbarCodec.decode}.
 *
 * Ids:
 *
 * For the IDs, there is an implicit behaviour in {@link Codec}: It moves the Id
 * from the cell to the user object at encoding time and vice versa at decoding
 * time. For example, if the Task node from above has an id attribute, then
 * the {@link Cell.id} of the corresponding cell will have this value. If there
 * is no Id collision in the model, then the cell may be retrieved using this
 * Id with the {@link GraphDataModel.getCell} function. If there is a collision, a new
 * Id will be created for the cell using {@link GraphDataModel.createId}. At encoding
 * time, this new Id will replace the value previously stored under the id
 * attribute in the Task node.
 *
 * See {@link EditorCodec}, {@link EditorToolbarCodec} and {@link EditorPopupMenuCodec}
 * for information about configuring the editor and user interface.
 *
 * ### Programmatically inserting cells
 *
 * For inserting a new cell, say, by clicking a button in the document,
 * the following code can be used. This requires an reference to the editor.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const userObject = new Object();
 * const model = editor.graph.model;
 * model.beginUpdate();
 * try {
 *   editor.graph.insertVertex({value: userObject, position: [20, 20], size: [80, 30]});
 * } finally
 *   model.endUpdate();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If a template cell from the config file should be inserted, then a clone
 * of the template can be created as follows. The clone is then inserted using
 * the add function instead of addVertex.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const template = editor.templates['task'];
 * cont clone = cloneCell(template);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Translations
 *
 * resources/editor - Language resources for Editor
 *
 * To load the resources for the Editor, the following code should be used:
 * ```javascript
 * // Load maxGraph builtin resources
 * Translations.loadResources();
 * // Load resources for the Editor
 * Translations.add(`${Client.basePath}/resources/editor`);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Callback: onInit
 *
 * Called from within the constructor. In the callback, "this" refers to the editor instance.
 *
 * ### Cookie: mxgraph=seen
 *
 * Set when the editor is started. Never expires. Use
 * {@link resetFirstTime} to reset this cookie. This cookie
 * only exists if {@link onInit} is implemented.
 *
 * ### Events
 *
 * #### Event: mxEvent.OPEN
 *
 * Fires after a file was opened in {@link open}. The <code>filename</code> property
 * contains the filename that was used. The same value is also available in
 * {@link filename}.
 *
 * #### Event: mxEvent.SAVE
 *
 * Fires after the current file was saved in {@link save}. The <code>url</code>
 * property contains the URL that was used for saving.
 *
 * #### Event: mxEvent.POST
 *
 * Fires if a successful response was received in {@link postDiagram}. The
 * <code>request</code> property contains the <MaxXmlRequest>, the
 * <code>url</code> and <code>data</code> properties contain the URL and the
 * data that were used in the post request.
 *
 * #### Event: mxEvent.ROOT
 *
 * Fires when the current root has changed, or when the title of the current
 * root has changed. This event has no properties.
 *
 * #### Event: mxEvent.BEFORE_ADD_VERTEX
 *
 * Fires before a vertex is added in {@link addVertex}. The <code>vertex</code>
 * property contains the new vertex and the <code>parent</code> property
 * contains its parent.
 *
 * #### Event: mxEvent.ADD_VERTEX
 *
 * Fires between begin- and endUpdate in <addVertex>. The <code>vertex</code>
 * property contains the vertex that is being inserted.
 *
 * #### Event: mxEvent.AFTER_ADD_VERTEX
 *
 * Fires after a vertex was inserted and selected in <addVertex>. The
 * <code>vertex</code> property contains the new vertex.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * For starting an in-place edit after a new vertex has been added to the
 * graph, the following code can be used.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * editor.addListener(mxEvent.AFTER_ADD_VERTEX, function(sender, evt) {
 *   const vertex = evt.getProperty('vertex');
 *   if (editor.graph.isCellEditable(vertex)) {
 *   	editor.graph.startEditingAtCell(vertex);
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Event: mxEvent.ESCAPE
 *
 * Fires when the escape key is pressed. The <code>event</code> property
 * contains the key event.
