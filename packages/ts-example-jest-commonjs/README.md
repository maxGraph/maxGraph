# Integrate `maxGraph` in CommonJS Jest tests with ts-jest

Demonstrate how to run jest tests involving `maxGraph` with ts-jest, using CommonJS.

`jest-jsdom` is required as `maxGraph` depends on browser objects.

## Setup

Initialize all packages
> From the repository root, run `npm install`.
 
Build maxgraph@core
> From the `packages/core` directory, run `npm run build`.
