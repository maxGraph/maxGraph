## Core `maxGraph` architecture

### The `maxGraph` Model

The mxGraph model is the core model that describes the structure
of the graph, the class is called GraphModel and is found within the
model package. Additions, changes and removals to and from the graph
structure take place through the graph model API. The model also
provides methods to determine the structure of the graph, as well as
offering methods to set visual states such as visibility, grouping and
style.

However, although the transactions to the model are stored on the
model, mxGraph is designed in such a way that the main public API is
through the mxGraph class. The concept of "add this cell to the
graph" is a more natural description of the action than "add
this cell to the model of the graph". Where it is intuitive,
functions available on the model and cells are duplicated on the graph
and those methods on the graph class are considered the main public API.
Throughout the rest of this manual these key API methods are given a pink background:

[//]: # (TODO there is no pink background in the markdown, nor in the mxGraph manual)

```javascript
anExampleCoreAPIMethod()
```

<p>So, though many of the main API calls are through the mxGraph
class, keep in mind that GraphModel is the underlying object that
stores the data structure of your graph.</p>

mxGraph uses a transactional system for making changes to the
model. In the HelloWorld example we saw this code:

[//]: # (TODO use the new insertVertex method)
```javascript
// Adds cells to the model in a single step
graph.getModel().beginUpdate();
try {
   const v1 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Hello,', 20, 20, 80, 30);
   const v2 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'World!', 200, 150, 80, 30);
   graph.insertEdge(parent, null, '', v1, v2);
}
finally {
   // Updates the display
   graph.getModel().endUpdate();
}
```

to perform the insertion of the 2 vertices and 1 edge. For each
change to the model you make a call to beginUpdate(), make the
appropriate calls to change the model, then call endUpdate() to finalize
the changes and have the change event notifications sent out.

**Key API Methods:**
  - **GraphModel.beginUpdate()** - starts a new transaction or a sub-transaction.
  - **GraphModel.endUpdate()** - completes a transaction or a sub-transaction.
  - **Graph.addVertex()** - Adds a new vertex to the specified parent cell.
  - **Graph.addEdge()** - Adds a new edge to the specified parent cell.


**Note** - Technically you do not have to
surround your changes with the _begin_ and _end_ update calls. Changes made
outside of this update scope take immediate effect and send out the
notifications immediately. In fact, changes within the update scope
enact on the model straight away, the update scope is there to control
the timing and concatenation of event notifications. Unless the update
wrapping causes code aesthetic issues, it is worth using it by habit to
avoid possible problems with event and undo granularity.

Note the way in which the model changes are wrapped in a try
block and the `endUpdate()` in a "finally" block. This ensures the update is
completed, even if there is an error in the model changes. You should
use this pattern wherever you perform model changes for ease of
debugging.

Ignore the reference to the `parent` cell for now, that will be
explained later in this chapter.


### The Transaction Model

<p>The sub-transaction in the blue block above refers to the fact
that transactions can be nested. That is, there is a counter in the
model that increments for every <em>beginUpdate</em> call and decrements
for every <em>endUpdate</em> call. After increasing to at least 1, when
this count reaches 0 again, the model transaction is considered complete
and the event notifications of the model change are fired.</p>

<p>This means that every sub-contained section of code can (and
should) be surrounded by the begin/end combination. This provide the
ability in mxGraph to create separate transactions that be used as
&ldquo;library transactions&rdquo;, the ability to create compound
changes and for one set of events to be fired for all the changes and
only one undo created. Automatic layouting is a good example of where
the functionality is required.</p>

<p>In automatic layouting, the user makes changes to the graph,
usually through the user interface, and the application automatically
positions the result according to some rules. The automatic positioning,
the layouting, is a self-contained algorithm between begin/end update
calls that has no knowledge of the specifics of the change. Because all
changes within the begin/end update are made directly to the graph
model, the layout can act upon the state of the model as the change is
in progress.</p>

<p>It is important to distinguish between functionality that acts on
the graph model as part of a compound change and functionality that
reacts to atomic graph change events. In the first case, such as for
automatic layouting, the functionality takes the model as-is and acts
upon it. This method should only be used for parts of compound model
changes. All other parts of the application should only react to model
change events.</p>

<p>Model change events are fired when the last endUpdate call
reduces the counter back down to 0 and indicate that at least one atomic
graph change has occurred. The change event contains complete
information as to what has altered (see later section on <strong>Events</strong>
for more details).</p>


#### The Model Change Methods

<p>Below is a list of the methods that alter the graph model and
should be placed, directly or indirectly, with the scope of an update:</p>

<ul>
	<li>add(parent, child, index)</li>
	<li>remove(cell)</li>
	<li>setCollapsed(cell, collapsed)</li>
	<li>setGeometry(cell, geometry)</li>
	<li>setRoot(root)</li>
	<li>setStyle(cell, style)</li>
	<li>setTerminal(cell, terminal, isSource)</li>
	<li>setTerminals(edge,source,target)</li>
	<li>setValue(cell, value)</li>
	<li>setVisible(cell, visible)</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, we will just concern ourselves with the add and
remove, as well as the geometry and style editing methods. Note that
these are not core API methods, as usual these methods are on the
mxGraph class, where appropriate, and they perform the update
encapsulation for you.</p>

<p><em>Design Background</em> - Some people are confused by the
presence of visual information being stored by the model. These
attributes comprise cell positioning, visibility and collapsed state.
The model stores the default state of these attributes, providing a
common place to set them on a per-cell basis, whereas, views can
override the values on a per-view basis. The model is simply the first
common place in the architecture where these attributes can be set on a
global basis. Remember, this is a graph <em>visualization</em> library,
the visualization part is the core functionality.</p>


##### Inserting Cells

<p>The three graph cells created in the <code>HelloWorld</code>
application are two vertices and one edge connecting the vertices. If
you are not familiar with basic graph theory and its terminology, please
see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">wikipedia
entry</a>.</p>

<p>You can add vertices and edges using the add() method on the
model. However, for the purposes of general usage of this library, learn
that mxGraph.insertVertex() and mxGraph.insertEdge() are the core public
API for adding cells. The function of the model requires that the cell
to be added is already created, whereas the mxGraph.insertVertex()
creates the cell for you.</p>

<p><strong>Core API functions:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>mxGraph.insertVertex(</strong><strong>parent,
	id, value, x, y, width, height, style</strong><strong>)</strong> &ndash; creates
	and inserts a new vertex into the model, within a begin/end update
	call.</li>
	<li><strong>mxGraph.insertEdge(</strong><strong>parent,
	id, value, source, target, style</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>
	&ndash; </strong>creates and inserts a new edge into the model, within a
	begin/end update call.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>mxGraph.insertVertex()</code> will create an `Cell` object
and return it from the method used. The parameters of the function are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>parent</strong> &ndash; the cell which is the immediate
parent of the new cell in the group structure. We will address the
group structure shortly, but for now use <code>graph.getDefaultParent();</code>
as your default parent, as used in the HelloWorld example.</li>

<li><strong>id</strong> &ndash; this is a global unique identifier
that describes the cell, it is always a string. This is primarily for
referencing the cells in the persistent output externally. If you do not
wish to maintain ids yourself, pass null into this parameter and ensure
that mxGraphModel.isCreateIds() returns true. This way the model will
manage the ids and ensure they are unique.</li>

<li><strong>value</strong> &ndash; this is the user object of the
cell. User object are simply that, just objects, but form the objects
that allow you to associate the business logic of an application with
the visual representation of mxGraph. They will be described in more
detail later in this manual, however, to start with if you use a string
as the user object, this will be displayed as the label on the vertex or
edge.</li>

<li><strong>x, y, width, height</strong> &ndash; as the names
suggest, these are the x and y position of the top left corner of the
vertex and its width and height.</li>

<li><strong>style</strong> &ndash; the style description to be
applied to this vertex. Styles will be described in more detail shortly,
but at a simple level this parameter is a string that follows a
particular format. In the string appears zero or more style names and
some number of key/value pairs that override the global style or set a
new style. Until we create custom styles, we will just use those
currently available.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the edge addition method, the identically named parameters
perform the same function as in the vertex addition method. The source
and target parameters define the vertices to which the edge is
connected. Note that the source and target vertices should already have
been inserted into the model.</p>


### Cell

`Cell` is the cell object for both vertices and edges. `Cell`
duplicates many of the functions available in the model. The key
difference in usage is that using the model methods creates the
appropriate event notifications and undo, using the cell makes the
change but there is no record of the change. This can be useful for
temporary visual effects such as animations or changes on a mouse over,
for example. As a general rule though, use the model editing API unless
you encounter a specific problem with this mechanism.

When creating a new cell, three things are required in the
constructor, a value (user object), a geometry and a style. We will now
explore these 3 concepts before returning to the cell.


#### Styles

:::warning
The following section is a direct copy of the mxGraph manual.
The style mechanism has changed in maxGraph (style is now an object, and no longer a string) and this section is not up-to-date.
:::

The concept of styles and stylesheets in conceptually similar to
CSS stylesheets, though note that CSS are actually used in mxGraph, but
only to affect global styles in the DOM of the HTML page. Open up the
util.mxConstants.js file in your editor and search for the first match
on &ldquo;STYLE_&rdquo;. If you scroll down you will see a large number
of strings defined for all the various styles available with this
prefix. Some of styles apply to vertices, some to edges and some to
both. As you can see, these define visual attributes on the element they
act upon.

The `Stylesheet` holds one object, styles, which is a hashtable
mapping style names to an array of styles:

![](./assets/model/styles.png)

_Style arrays within the styles collection_


In the above image the blue box represents the styles hashtable
in mxStyleSheet. The string 'defaultVertex' is the key to an array of
string/value pairs, which are the actual styles. Note that mxGraph
creates two default styles, one for vertices and one for edges. If you
look back to the helloworld example, no style was passed into the
optional style parameter of insertVertex or insertEdge. In this case the
default style would be used for those cells.

<h5><a id="setting_cell_style"></a>Setting the Style of a Cell</h5>

<p>If you wanted to specify a style other than the default for a
cell, you must pass that new style either to the cell when it is created
(mxGraph's insertVertex and insertEdge both have an optional parameter
for this) or pass that style to the cell using model.setStyle().</p>

<p>The style that you pass has the form stylename. ,note that the
stylenames and key/value pairs may be in any order. Below are examples
to demonstrate this concept, adapting the insertVertex call we saw in
helloworld:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>A new style called 'ROUNDED' has been created, to apply this to
	a vertex:</p>
	<pre>var v1 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Hello', 20, 20, 80, 30, 'ROUNDED');</pre>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>To create a new vertex with the ROUNDED style, overriding the
	stroke and fill colors:</p>
	<pre>var v1 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Hello',  20, 20, 80, 30, 'ROUNDED;strokeColor=red;fillColor=green');</pre>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>To create a new vertex with no global style, but with local
	stroke and fill colors:</p>
	<pre>var v1 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Hello', 20, 20, 80, 30, ';strokeColor=red;fillColor=green');</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To create a vertex that uses the defaultVertex style, but a
	local value of the fill color:</p>
	<pre>var v1 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Hello', 20, 20, 80, 30, 'defaultVertex;fillColor=blue');</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<br/>
<p>Note that default style must be explicitly named in this case,
missing the style out sets no global style on the cell when the
semi-colon starts the string. If the string starts with no semi-colon,
the default style is used.</p>

<p>Again, the mxGraph class provides utility functions that form the
core API for accessing and changing the styles of cells:</p>

<p><strong>Core API functions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>mxGraph.setCellStyle(style, cells)</strong> &ndash; Sets
the style for the array of cells, encapsulated in a begin/end update.
</li>
<li>
<strong>mxGraph.getCellStyle(cell)</strong> &ndash; Returns the
style for the specified cell, merging the styles from any local style
and the default style for that cell type.
</li>
</ul>


##### Creating a New Global Style

<p>To create the ROUNDED global style described above, you can
follow this template to create a style and register it with
mxStyleSheet:</p>

<pre>
let style = {};
style[mxConstants.STYLE_SHAPE] = mxConstants.SHAPE_RECTANGLE;
style[mxConstants.STYLE_OPACITY] = 50;
style[mxConstants.STYLE_FONTCOLOR]= '#774400';
graph.getStylesheet().putCellStyle('ROUNDED',style);
</pre>


#### Geometry

<p>In the helloworld example we saw the position and size of the
vertices passed into the insertVertex function. The coordinate system in
JavaScript is x is positive to the right and y is positive downwards,
and in terms of the graph, the positioning is absolute to the container
within which the mxGraph is placed.</p>

<p>The reason for a separate mxGeometry class, as opposed to simply
having the mxRectangle class store this information, is that the edges
also have geometry information.</p>

<p>The width and height values are ignored for edges and the x and y
values relate to the positioning of the edge label. In addition, edges
have the concept of control points. These are intermediate points along
the edge that the edge is drawn as passing through. The use of control
points is sometimes referred to as <strong>edge routing</strong>.</p>

![Edge Routing](./assets/model/edge_routing.png)

_An edge routed by 2 control points_

<p>There are two more important additional concepts in geometry,
relative positioning and offsets</p>


##### Relative Positioning

<p>By default, the x and y position of a vertex is the offset of the
top left point of the bounding rectangle of the parent to the top left
point of the bounding rectangle of the cell itself. The concept of
parents and groups is discussed later in this chapter, but without going
into too much detail, if a cell does not have cell parent, the graph
container is its parent for positioning purposes.</p>


![Non relative vertex positioning](./assets/model/non_relative_positioning_vertex.png)

_Non-relative vertex positioning_


<p>For an edge, in non-relative mode, which is the default mode, the
edge label position is the absolute offset from the graph origin.</p>

![Non relative edge positioning](./assets/model/non_relative_positioning_edge.png)

_Non-relative edge label positioning_


<p>For vertices in relative mode, (x,y) is the proportion along the
parent cell's (width, height) where the cell's origin lies. (0,0) is the
same origin as the parent, (1,1) places the origin at the bottom right
corner of the parent. The same relative positioning extends below 0 and
above 1 for both dimensions. This positioning is useful for keeping
child cells fixed relative to the overall parent cell size.</p>

![](./assets/model/relative_positioning_vertex.png)

_Relative vertex positions_

<p>Lastly, edge labels in relative mode are placed based on the
positioning from the center of the edge. The x-coordinate is the
relative distance from the source end of the edge, at -1, to the target
end of the edge, at 1. The y co-ordinate is the pixel offset orthogonal
from the edge. The diagram below shows the values of x,y for various
edge labels in relative mode. Note that for a straight edge, the
calculations are simple. For edges with multiple control points, the
edge has to be traced along its segments (a segment being the line
between end points and/or control points) to find the correct distance
along the edge. The y value is the orthogonal offset from that segment.</p>

<p>Switching relative positioning on for edge labels is a common
preference for applications. Navigate to the mxGraph.insertEdge()
function in mxGraph, you will see this calls createEdge(). In
createEdge() the geometry is set relative for every edge created using
this prototype. This is partly the reason for the amount of helper
functions in mxGraph, they enable easy changing of the default
behaviour. You should try to use the mxGraph class API as much as
possible to provide this benefit in your applications.</p>


##### Offsets

The offset field in mxGeometry is an absolute x,y offset applied
to the cell <strong>label</strong>. In the case of edge labels, the
offset is always applied after the edge label has been calculated
according to the relative flag in the above section.

**Core API functions:**

- **mxGraph.resizeCell(cell, bounds)** - Resizes the specified cell to the specified bounds, within a begin/end update call.
- **mxGraph.resizeCells(cells, bounds)** - Resizes each of the cells in the cells array to the corresponding entry
in the bounds array, within a begin/end update call.


#### User Objects

<p>The User object is what gives mxGraph diagrams a context, it
stores the business logic associated with a visual cell. In the
HelloWorld example the user object has just been a string, in this case
it simply represents the label that will be displayed for that cell. In
more complex applications, these user objects will be objects instead.
Some attribute of that object will generally be the label that the
visual cell will display, the rest of the object describes logic
relating to the application domain.</p>

<p>Using the example of a simple workflow or process application,
say we have the graph below (<a
	href="http://www.jgraph.com/demo/mxgraph/editors/workfloweditor.html">this
example is available online</a>, select the Swimlanes example from the tasks
window):</p>


![](./assets/model/mx_man_simple_workflow.png)

_A simple workflow_


<p>Typically, this workflow will exist on some application server
and/or database. The browser user connects to that server, or some
front-end server linked to the application server and the user's web
application requests the &ldquo;order&rdquo; workflow. The server
obtains the data of that workflow and transmits it to the client.</p>

<p>mxGraph supports the process of populating the model on the
server-side and transmitting to the client, and back again. See the
later chapter on &ldquo;I/O and Server Communication&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The data transmitted will be both the visual model (the diagram)
as well as the business logic (mostly contained in the user objects).
The client will initially show the diagram above. If the user has
permission to edit this workflow they will normally be able to do two
things, 1) edit the diagram, add and remove vertices, as well as
changing the connections, and 2) edit the user objects of the cells
(vertices and/or edges).</p>

<p>In the online demo, if you right click and select properties of
the &ldquo;Check Inventory&rdquo; diamond you will see this dialog:</p>

![](./assets/model/mx_man_vertex_props.png)

_The properties of a vertex_

<p>These properties show the geometry, label, ID etc, but a dialog
could just as easily show the user object of the cell. There might be a
reference to some process on the workflow engine as to how the inventory
is actually checked. This might be an application specific mechanism for
both the server and client to assign some identification to remote
method calls. Another value might be the type of object that process
returned, maybe a boolean or an integer to indicate stock level in this
case. Given that return type, it is possible to enforce constraints with
the diagram and provide visual alerts of if, say, the outgoing edges
decision check does not correspond to the return type of the vertex.</p>

<p>Next, as an example, the user objects of the outgoing edges might
contain a label and a boolean state. Again, the mxGraph-based editor
might provide the means to alter the boolean value. On the server, when
executing the process, it might follow the edges that correspond to the
boolean value returned by the decision node.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the above example is very domain specific, it
is there to explain how the user object maps to the business logic of
the application. It visualizes how mxGraph creates what we term a <strong>contextual
graph</strong>. The context is formed by the connections between vertices and the
business logic stored within the user objects. A typical application
receives the visual and business logic from a sever, may allow editing
of both, then transmits both back to the server for persistence and/or
execution.</p>


#### Cell Types

<p>As described previously, mxGraph is the primary API for using
this library and the same concept applies to cells. One basic state of
the cell not exposed on the graph is whether a cell is a vertex or an
edge, this call be performed on the cell or on the model.</p>

<p>There are two boolean flags on mxCell, vertex and edge, and the
helper methods set one of these to true when the cell is created.
isVertex(), isEdge() on mxIGraphModel are what the model uses to
determine a cell's type, there are not separate objects for either type.
Technically, it is possible to switch the type of a cell at runtime, but
take care to invalidate the cell state (see later section) after
changing the type. Also, be aware that the geometry object variable
means different things to vertices and edges. Generally, it is not
recommended to change a cell type at runtime.</p>


### Group Structure

<p>Grouping, within mxGraph, is the concept of logically associating
cells with one another. This is commonly referred to as the concept of
sub-graphs in many graph toolkits. Grouping involves one or more
vertices or edges becoming children of a parent vertex or edge (usually
a vertex) in the graph model data structure. Grouping allows mxGraph to
provide a number of useful features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sub-graphs, the concept of a logically separate graph that is
	displayed in the higher level graph as a cell per sub-graph.</li>

	<li>Expanding and collapsing. Collapsing is the ability to replace
	a collection of grouped cells visually with just their parent cell.
	Expanding is the reverse of this. This behaviour can be seen by
	clicking the small &ldquo;-&rdquo; in the top left corner of the group
	cells of the swimlanes example in the <a
		href="http://www.jgraph.com/demo/mxgraph/editors/workfloweditor.html">online
	workfloweditor</a> example. This is described in the C<em>omplexity
	Management</em> section below.</li>

	<li>Layering. Layering is the concept of assigning cells to a
	particular z-order layer within the graph display.</li>

	<li>Drill down, step up. These concepts allow sub-graphs to be
	visualized and edited as if they are a complete graph. In the <em>User
	Objects</em> section we saw the &ldquo;check inventory&rdquo; vertex as a
	single cell. Take, for example, the case where a developer is
	describing each of the vertices in the process as the software
	processes that perform the task. The application might have an option
	to drill down into the check inventory vertex. This would result in a
	new graph appearing that describes in detail how exactly the system
	checks the inventory. The graph might have the title of the parent
	&ldquo;check inventory&rdquo; vertex to indicate it is a child, as well
	as the option to step-up back to the next level up.</li>
</ul>

<p>In grouping, cells are assigned a parent cell. In the simplest
case, all cells have the default parent as their parent. The default
parent is an invisible cell with the same bounds as the graph. This is
the cell returned by graph.getDefaultParent() in the helloworld example.
The x,y position of a vertex is its position relative to its parent, so
in the case of default grouping (all cells sharing the default parent)
the cell positioning is also the absolute co-ordinates on the graph
component. In the case all cells being added to the default root, the
group structure logically looks like, in the case of the helloworld
example, the diagram below.</p>

<p>Note the addition of the Layer 0 cell, this is the default
indirection in the group structure that allows layer changes with the
requirement of additional cells. We include it below for correctness,
but in later group diagrams it will be omitted.</p>


![](./assets/model/mx_man_hello_struct.png)

_The group structure of the helloworld example_

<p>Also, note that the position of the edge label (x,y in geometry)
is relative to the parent cell.</p>

<p>If we go back to the simple workflow example in the User Objects
section, we can see what grouping might look like visually. In the
example the group cells represent people and the child vertices
represent tasks assigned to those people. In this example the logical
group structure looks like this:</p>

![](./assets/model/mx_man_log_group_struct.png)

_The logical group structure of the workflow example_

<p>The workflow action vertices are the yellow children and the
swimlane group vertices are marked blue.</p>

<p>Inserting cells into the group structure is achieved using the
parent parameter of the insertVertex and insertEdge functions on the
mxGraph class. These functions set the parent cell on the child
accordingly and, importantly, informs the parent cell of its new child.</p>

<p>Altering the group structure is performed via the
mxGraph.groupCells() and mxGraph.ungroupCells() functions.</p>

**Core API functions:**

- **mxGraph.groupCells(group, border, cells)** - Adds the specified cells to the specified group, within a begin/end update
- **mxGraph.ungroupCells(cells)** - Removes the specified cells from their parent and adds them to their parent's
parent. Any group empty after the operation are deleted. The operation occurs within a begin/end update.


### Complexity Management

<p>There are two primary reasons to control the number of cells
displayed at any one time. The first is performance, drawing more and
more cells will reach performance usability limits at some point on any
platform. The second reason is ease of use, a human can only comprehend
a certain amount of information. All of the concepts associated with
grouping, listed above, can be used to reduce the complexity of
information on the screen for the user.</p>

#### Folding

<p>Folding is the collective term we use for expanding and
collapsing groups. We say a cell is folded by making it's child vertices
invisible. There are a number of functions relating to this feature:</p>

<p><strong>Core API function:</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>mxGraph.foldCells(collapse, recurse, cells)</strong>
&ndash; States the collapsed state of the specificed cells, within a
begin/end update.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Folding related functions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>mxGraph.isCellFoldable(cell, collapse)</strong> &ndash;
By default true for cells with children.</p>
<p><strong>mxGraph.isCellCollapsed(cell)</strong> &ndash; Returns
the folded state of the cell</p>

<p>When a group cell is collapsed, three things occur by default:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The children of that cell become invisible.</li>
	<li>The group bounds of the group cell is used. Within mxGeometry
	there is a alternativeBounds field and in groups cells, by default
	store a separate bounds for their collapsed and expanded states. The
	switch between these instances is invoked by mxGraph.swapBounds() and
	this is handled for you within a foldCells() call. This allows

	<li>Edge promotion occurs, by default. Edge promotion means
	displaying edges that connect to children within the collapsed group
	that also connect to cells outside of the collapsed group, by making
	them appear to connect to the collapsed parent.</li>
</ul>

_Expanded swimlane_

_Collapsed swimlane_


<p>The above two images demonstrate these three concepts. In its
expanded state the upper group cell displays a small box in the top left
hand corner with a &ldquo;-&rdquo; character inside. This indicates that
clicking on this box collapses the group cell. Doing this we get the
bottom image where the group cell takes on its collapsed size. Child
vertices and edge that do not leave the group cell are made invisible.
Finally, edges that exit the group cell are promoted to appear to be
connected to the collapsed group cell. Clicking on the &ldquo;+&rdquo;
character that now appears within the box expands the group cell and
brings it back to its original state of the top image.</p>

<p>Using the mxGraph.foldCells() function, you can achieve the same
result programmatically as clicking on the expand/collapse symbols. One
common usage of this is when the application zooms out a specific
amount, clusters of cells are grouped and the grouped cell collapsed
(very often without the &ldquo;-&rdquo; box since the application is
controlling the folding). This way fewer, larger cells are visible to
the user, each one representing their children cells logically. You
might then provide a mechanism to zoom into a group, which expands it in
the process. You might also provide drill-down/step-up, explained next.</p>


#### Sub-Graphs, Drill-Down / Step-Up

<p>Sometimes, as an alternative to expand/collapse, or possibly in
combination with it, your graph will be composed of a number of graphs,
nested into a hierarchy. Below we see a simple example:</p>


![](./assets/model/mx_man_drill_down.png)

_An example top level workflow_

<p>This simple workflow consists of three high level steps.
Obviously, the individual steps contain a number of sub-steps and we
will look at a sub-graph of the <em>Solve Bug</em> cell.</p>

<p>Under the <em>Solve Bug</em> vertex we have created a number of
children to represent the process of solving a bug in more detail, in
this case the process of solving a bug on the <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise">Starship
Enterprise</a>.</p>

<p>In this example, which uses the GraphEditor example, the menu
option shown selected in the above image invokes
mxGraph.enterGroup(cell), which is one of the pair of core API functions
for sub-graphs.</p>


**Core API functions:**

- **mxGraph.enterGroup(cell)** - Makes the specified cell the new root of the display area.
- **mxGraph.exitGroup()** - Makes the parent of the current root cell, if any, the new root cell.
- **mxGraph.home()** - Exits all groups, making the default parent the root cell.

<p>The root cell of the graph has been, up to now, the default
parent vertex to all first-level cells. Using these functions you can
make any group cell in the group structure the root cell, so that the
children of that parent appear in the display as the complete graph.</p>

_Result of drilling down into the Solve Bug vertex_


<p>The same graph expanded using folding instead looks like:</p>

![](./assets/model/mx_man_top_level.png)


<p>Exiting the group using the <em>shape-&gt;exit group</em> option,
which invokes mxGraph.exitGroup, brings you back to the original 3
vertex top level graph.</p>


#### Layering and Filtering

<p>In mxGraph, like many graphical applications, there is the
concept of z-order. That is, the order of objects as you look into the
screen direction. Objects can be behind or in front of other objects and
if they overlap and are opaque then the back-most object will be
partially or complete obscured. Look back to the <a href="#ill_mx_man_hello_struct">
graph structure of HelloWorld illustration</a> above. Children cells are stored under
parents in a deterministic order (by default the order in which you add
them).</p>

<p>If we move the cells in the HelloWorld example we see the
following result:</p>

![](./assets/model/mx_man_overlap.png)

_Overlapped vertices_

<p>It can be seen that the <em>World</em> vertex is in front of the
<em>Hello</em> vertex. This is because the <em>World</em> vertex has a
higher child index than the <em>Hello</em> vertex, at positions 1 and 0
respectively in the ordered collection that holds the children of the
root cell.</p>

<p>To change order we use mxGraph.orderCells.</p>


<p><strong>Core API function:</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>mxGraph.orderCells(back, cells)</strong> &ndash; Moves
the array of cells to the front or back of their siblings, depending on
the flag, within a begin/end update.</li></ul>

<p>A sibling cell in mxGraph is any cell that shares the same
parent. So by invoking this on the <em>Hello</em> vertex it would then
overlap the <em>World</em> Vertex.</p>

<p>Ordering and grouping can be extended to form logically layered
groups. The cells are drawn via a depth-first search. Take the
HelloWorld example again and imagine that both the <em>Hello</em> and <em>World
</em>vertices have some hierarchy of children underneath them. The <em>Hello</em>
vertex and all of its children will be drawn before the <em>World</em>
vertex or any of its children. If <em>Hello</em> and <em>World</em> were
invisible group cells you then have two hierarchies of cells, one being
drawn entirely before the other. You can also switch the order of the
hierarchies by simply switching the order of the invisible group cells.</p>

<p>The concept of layering is demonstrated in the layers.html
example. Here buttons are used to set the visibility of group layer
cells. This example ties very closely into the concept of filtering.</p>

<p>In filtering cells with some particular attribute are displayed.
One option to provide filtering functionality is to check some state
before rendering the cells. Another method, if the filtering conditions
are simple and known in advance, is to assign filterable cells by
groups. Making the groups visible and invisible performs this filtering
operation.</p>
