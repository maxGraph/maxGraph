# Codecs

TODO
- name: XML serialization? Codecs and Serialization?
- add an intro
- reorg paragraphs, in particular where to put the paragraph about registering codecs
- link to the codec API class provides other examples

## Introduction

The `Codec` feature is used for serialization and deserialization of objects in XML format.
It can be used to export and import `maxGraph` data, for example to save and load the state of graphs or the configuration of a graph.

The serialization/deserialization process is based on `Codec` classes that maps the maxGraph objects to XML nodes and attributes.
The codecs are registered in the `CodecRegistry` to let `maxGraph` knows how to map a class to its related `Codec`.

**TODO:** explain import/export, encode/decode

## Codecs registration

To register codecs, you can use the `registerModelCodecs` function, which registers the codecs for the `maxGraph` model.

list of function here


:::warning

From [version 0.6.0](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.6.0) of `maxGraph`, codecs supplied by maxGraph are no longer registered by default, they **MUST** be registered before performing an `encode` or `decode`

For example:
- You can use the `registerModelCodecs` function (or other related functions) to register the Model codecs.
- To serialize the `maxGraph` model, you can use the `ModelXmlSerializer` class, which registers codecs under the hood and provide a simpler syntax.

## Encoding/Export and Decoding/Import

also named import/export
To encode and decode data, you can use the `encode` and `decode` functions.

TODO example


## Special support of the GraphDataModel


### ModelXmlSerializer

TODO rationale (cf PR which introduced it)

example

### import/decode mxGraph models

- rationale: allow interoperability with mxGraph and possibility draw.io/diagrams.net
- example
- no support for export/encode mxGraph models


## Examples and Demos

More complex examples and demos involving Codecs are available in the `maxGraph` repository.

Load a data model from an XML file using ModelXmlSerializer or a custom text file with custom parsing (no Codecs involved)
- live demo: [FileIO](https://maxgraph.github.io/maxGraph/demo/?path=/story/xml-json-fileio--default) 
- source code: [FileIO.stories.ts](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/blob/main/packages/html/stories/FileIO.stories.ts)

Import mxGraph data model
- live demo: [CodecImport_mxGraph](https://maxgraph.github.io/maxGraph/demo/?path=/story/misc-codecimport-mxgraph--default)
- source code: [Codec.stories.ts](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/blob/main/packages/html/stories/Codec.stories.ts)

Import vertex including custom XML data in the Cell value, with ModelXmlSerializer and a CustomCodec to handle the custom XML data
- live demo: [JsonData](https://maxgraph.github.io/maxGraph/demo/?path=/story/xml-json-jsondata--default)
- source code: [JsonData.stories.ts](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/blob/main/packages/html/stories/JsonData.stories.ts)

Export the data model to an XML file using ModelXmlSerializer, custom data in the Cell value?
- live demo: [UserObject](https://maxgraph.github.io/maxGraph/demo/?path=/story/xml-json-userobject--default)
- source code: [UserObject.stories.ts](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/blob/main/packages/html/stories/UserObject.stories.ts)

In addition, the `js-example` package in this repository is importing an maxGraph model stored as XML string. This is a vanilla JS project built with Webpack.
So, it should contain everything you need for your use case. See https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/blob/v0.14.0/packages/js-example/src/index.js



## Troubleshooting

The most common error you may encounter when using Codecs is the "maximum call stack trace" error. It occurs when a class that you are trying to encode doesn't have a codec registered.

```
Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
    at ObjectCodec.writeAttribute (ObjectCodec.js:384:19)
    at ObjectCodec.encodeValue (ObjectCodec.js:376:22)
    at ObjectCodec.encodeObject (ObjectCodec.js:346:22)
    at ObjectCodec.encode (ObjectCodec.js:326:14)
    at Codec.encode (Codec.js:285:28)
    at ObjectCodec.writeComplexAttribute (ObjectCodec.js:415:27)
    at ObjectCodec.writeAttribute (ObjectCodec.js:389:18)
    at ObjectCodec.encodeValue (ObjectCodec.js:376:22)
    at ObjectCodec.encodeObject (ObjectCodec.js:346:22)
    at ObjectCodec.encode (ObjectCodec.js:326:14)
```

Generally, this error is thrown when you try to encode a class that is not registered in the `CodecRegistry`. To fix this error, you need to register the codec for the class.
Start by using one of the [_register_ functions](xx) provided by `maxGraph`.


### Example

Here is a real example taken from [issue #323](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/issues/323):

```js
const encoder = new Codec();
const result = encoder.encode(graph.getDataModel());
xmlUtils.getPrettyXml(result);
```

Solution: 
- Call the `` function use the code above prior calling the code above 
- Alternatively, you can use the `ModelXmlSerializer` class to import the `GraphDataModel`


## Using custom object and custom Codec

:::


The default encoding scheme maps all non-object fields to string attributes and all object fields to child nodes, using the constructor
name of the object as the node name and the field name for the as-attribute value.
This default encoding scheme may be overridden by custom codecs, which are registered in the `CodecRegistry`.

For example, consider the following JavaScript object definition:
```typescript
const object = {
    myBool: true,
    myObject: {
        name: 'Test'
    },
    myArray: ['a', ['b', 'c'], 'd']
};
```

To encode/export this object and show the resulting XML in a new window, the following code is used:

```typescript
import { Codec, popup } from '@mxgraph/core';

const encoder = new Codec();
const node = encoder.encode(object);
popup(mxUtils.getXml(node));
```


And here is the XML structure that represents the object:
```xml
<Object myBool="1">
  <Object name="Test" as="myObject"/>
  <Array as="myArray">
    <add value="a"/>
    <Array>
      <add value="b"/>
      <add value="c"/>
    </Array>
    <add value="d"/>
  </Array>
</Object>
```

Note that the codecs will turn booleans into numeric values, no array indices are stored if they are numeric and non-object
array members are stored inside the value-attribute.
Furthermore, one may include other XML files by use of the `include` directive in the XML structures.


### Registering custom codecs
