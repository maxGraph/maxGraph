# Codecs

:::warning

From [version 0.6.0](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.6.0) of `maxGraph`, codecs supplied by maxGraph are no longer registered by default, they **MUST** be registered before performing an `encode` or `decode`

For example:
- You can use the `registerModelCodecs` function (or other related functions) to register the Model codecs.
- To serialize the `maxGraph` model, you can use the `ModelXmlSerializer` class, which registers codecs under the hood and provide a simpler syntax.
