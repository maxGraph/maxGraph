description: How to use i18n with maxGraph.
---

## Introduction

`maxGraph` provides an internationalization (i18n) mechanism to support multiple languages in your application.

Some parts of the API return or display messages that can be translated using key/value pairs with optional parameter substitution.

The i18n mechanism is pluggable via the `I18nProvider` abstraction, so it allows you to use various i18n solutions, such as:
- built-in solutions provided by `maxGraph`
- custom implementations to use the i18n solution already used in your application.

:::warning

By default, `maxGraph` uses a no-op i18n implementation that provides no translations.

This keeps the library lightweight because not all applications need internationalization.
Skipping built-in translations helps reduce bundle size and improve tree-shaking during the build process.

## Built-in Provider

`maxGraph` includes a built-in provider, `TranslationsAsI18n`, which uses the `Translations` class to load and manage resource files.

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, this mechanism is not enabled by default. So to use it in your application, configure it like this:
```javascript
GlobalConfig.i18n = new TranslationsAsI18n();
```

By default, the following conventions apply:
- Resource files use the `.txt` extension.
- The default language is the browser's language, with a fallback to English.

You can override these defaults using the `TranslationsConfig` class. For example, the language support can be configured via `TranslationsConfig.setLanguages`.

`maxGraph` includes built-in translations for the following languages, covering `Graph` and `Editor`:
- Chinese
- English
- French
- German
- Spanish

These resource files are located in the `resources` folder of the npm package:
- `resources/editor*.txt`
- `resources/graph*.txt`

The format of the resource files is as follows:
```txt
# Comment
key=value
# Another comment
key2=value2
```


### Loading i18n Resources

To load a resource, you need to:
1. Ensure that the i18n files are available in your application so they can be fetched via a GET request. This usually involves copying the resource files from the `maxGraph` npm package into a dedicated folder within your application.
2. Use either `Translations.add` or `Translations.loadResources` to load the required resources. When using `Translations.loadResources`, files are fetched from `${Client.basePath}/resources/`.

### Examples

The Storybook demo showcases how to configure and use the i18n mechanism in different scenarios.

Resource files are loaded in the [`preview.ts`](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/blob/main/packages/html/.storybook/preview.ts) file.

The following stories illustrate the translation of validation messages. Try connecting the same vertices twice to trigger a validation error displayed in a browser alert:
- **Validation story**:
  - **Live demo**: [Validation](https://maxgraph.github.io/maxGraph/demo/?path=/story/misc-validation--default)
  - **Source code**: [Validation.stories.js](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/blob/main/packages/html/stories/Validation.stories.js)
- **Permissions story**:
  - **Live demo**: [Permissions](https://maxgraph.github.io/maxGraph/demo/?path=/story/misc-permissions--default)
  - **Source code**: [Permissions.stories.js](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/blob/main/packages/html/stories/Permissions.stories.js)

In the `HelloPort` story, select an edge to display a translated message in the tooltip of the bend point. (Note: The double-click action does not work, same behavior as in mxGraph.)
- **Live demo**: [HelloPort](https://maxgraph.github.io/maxGraph/demo/?path=/story/misc-helloport--default)
- **Source code**: [HelloPort.stories.ts](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/blob/main/packages/html/stories/HelloPort.stories.ts)


## Custom Provider

You can implement a custom i18n provider if your application already uses a different translation system.

To do this:

1. Create a class that implements the `I18nProvider` interface â€” let's call it `MyI18nProvider`.
2. Register it with:

```js
GlobalConfig.i18n = new MyI18nProvider();
```

This gives you full control over how translations are handled inside `maxGraph`, making it easy to integrate with any existing i18n setup.
