# Demos and Examples

For more complete examples than the [“Getting started” example](./manual/getting-started.md), please have a look at:

- the [storybook stories](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/tree/main/packages/html/stories) which demonstrates various features of maxGraph.
    - The stories are currently written in `JavaScript` and will be progressively migrated to `TypeScript`.
    - A live instance is available on the [maxGraph website](https://maxgraph.github.io/maxGraph/demo).
- the [ts-example](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/tree/main/packages/ts-example) project/application that demonstrates how to define and use custom `Shapes` with `maxGraph`. It is a vanilla TypeScript application built by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- the [ts-example-without-defaults](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/tree/main/packages/ts-example-without-defaults) project/application that demonstrates how to not use defaults plugins and style defaults (shapes, perimeters, ...). It is a vanilla TypeScript application built by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- the [js-example](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/tree/main/packages/js-example) project/application that demonstrates how import and export the `maxGraph` model with XML data. It is a vanilla JavaScript application built by [Webapck](https://webpack.js.org/).
- the [js-example-without-defaults](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/tree/main/packages/js-example-without-defaults) project/application that demonstrates how to not use defaults plugins and style defaults (shapes, perimeters, ...). It is a vanilla JavaScript application built by [Webapck](https://webpack.js.org/).
- the https://github.com/maxGraph/maxgraph-integration-examples repository which shows how to integrate `maxGraph` with different frameworks and build tools.


Notice that some elements produced by `maxGraph` require to use [CSS and images](./usage/css-and-images.md) provided in the npm package.
