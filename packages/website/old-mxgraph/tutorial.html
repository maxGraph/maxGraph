<h1><a id="Overview"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The mxGraph package contains a client software, written in JavaScript, and a series
  of backends for various languages. The client software is a graph component with
  an optional application wrapper that is integrated into an existing web interface.
  The client requires a webserver to deliver the required files to the client or
  can be run from the local filesystem without a webserver. The backends may be used
  as is, or they may be embedded into an existing server application in one of the
  supported languages.
</p>

<p>
  If a backend exists, then the client may be configured to use this backend in
  various ways, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating images</li>
  <li>Storing and loading diagrams</li>
  <li>Creating an object representation of a graph</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The above scenarios maybe combined in various ways, such as sending an XML
  description of each change to the backend as it happens, or autosaving of
  the diagram to avoid loss of data on the client. The client can also operate in
  offline mode, where it does not require a backend or a webserver.
</p>
<p>
  Please have a look at the index files in the respective directories for
  information on the various backends.

<h2><a id="Library"></a>Library</h2>
<p>
  The HEAD part of the page contains the JavaScript code and dependencies.
  The library is loaded using the following code. The  <code>mxBasePath</code>
  variable is used to define the path where the library loads its resources
  from. This variable must be defined prior to loading the library code and
  should not include a trailing slash.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  mxBasePath = 'javascript/src';
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="javascript/src/js/mxClient.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph/tree/master/javascript"><code>mxClient.min.js</code></a>
  contains all required code in a single, minified, file. This is the file you
  should use in production. During development, if you wish to change mxGraph
  sources, use the bootstrapped <a href="https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph/blob/master/javascript/src/js/mxClient.js"><code>mxClient.js</code></a> file.
</p>
<h2><a id="BrowserCheck"></a>Browser Check</h2>
<p>
  The next script tag in the HEAD part of the page contains the
  Hello, World! example code. The first part of the code checks if the
  browser that is displaying the page is supported by the library. It is
  recommended to do this as the first step of the program and
  display an error message if the browser is not supported. In your
  document you may also want to include a NOSCRIPT directive for
  browsers that have JavaScript disabled, however, in our examples this
  directive is not used.
</p>
<p>
  There is no convention for the name of the main function. The function
  is invoked from the <code>onload</code> handler in the page and may have any name
  and arguments. In this case, the argument is a  DOM node that will contain
  the graph. Note that the DOM node may have any ID and that the code
  is independent of this ID.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript";&gt;
function main(container)
{
  // Checks if the browser is supported
  if (!mxClient.isBrowserSupported())
  {
    // Displays an error message if the browser is not supported.
    mxUtils.error('Browser is not supported!', 200, false);
  }
  ...
</pre>
