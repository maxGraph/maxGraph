# Welcome to the maxGraph Demo ‚ú®

The demo, built with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), showcases the features of `maxGraph` through interactive examples. Stories are organized by functionality, making it easy to explore different capabilities of the library.

## üîç What You'll Find Here

- **Feature Demonstrations**: Each story focuses on specific capabilities, from basic graph rendering to advanced interactions
- **Combination Examples**: See how multiple features work together to create powerful graph applications
- **Extension Patterns**: Learn how to extend `maxGraph` for custom requirements
- **Interactive Controls**: Many stories include [Storybook controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7/essentials/controls) that let you experiment with parameters in real-time

## üöÄ Continuous Improvement

We regularly add new examples that:
- Demonstrate recently added features
- Cover additional use cases
- Provide clearer documentation within the stories themselves
- Link to detailed documentation for more complex topics

## üíª Technical Details

- Stories are being progressively migrated from _JavaScript_ to _TypeScript_
- The examples evolved from the original `mxGraph` codebase:
  - [mxGraph live examples](https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/javascript/index.html)
  - [mxGraph examples source](https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph/tree/v4.2.2/javascript/examples/)
- Some stories may still be under active development

## ü§ù Support
