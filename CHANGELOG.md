# `maxGraph` Change Log

All versions and breaking changes of [maxGraph](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph) are documented here. We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) for versions.

For more details on the contents of a release, see [the GitHub release page] (https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases).


## Unreleased

_**Note:** Yet to be released breaking changes appear here._

## 0.21.0

Release date: `2025-07-22`

For more details, see the [0.21.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.21.0) on the GitHub release page.

This release improves Webpack and Node.js compatibility, removes legacy code, and slightly reduces bundle size.

**Breaking Changes**:
- The `AbstractGraph.fit` method moved to `FitPlugin`, as well as the `minFitScale` and `maxFitScale` properties.
  The method now accepts a single parameter, mainly to minimize the need to pass many default values.
- The `Dictionary` class has been removed. The maxGraph API use the `Map` class instead, which is a standard JavaScript feature.
  If your code depends on the `Dictionary` class, you can use the `Map` class instead.
- The `arcSize` of rounded shapes was not always correctly computed in the past. The computation is now consistent everywhere in the code and matches the mxGraph behavior.
To have the same rendering as before for edges, you must multiply the `arcSize` by `2` in your styles.
- The `AbstractGraph.getPlugin` method now explicitly returns `undefined` when a plugin is not found.  
  TypeScript users must update their code to handle the `undefined` case when calling this method.
- The return types of some methods of EditorToolbar are now more precise.
  - addPrototype(): HTMLImageElement instead of HTMLImageElement | HTMLButtonElement
  - addCombo(): HTMLSelectElement instead of HTMLElement

## 0.20.0

Release date: `2025-05-16`

For more details, see the [0.20.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.20.0) on the GitHub release page.

This new version improves registry consistency, removes legacy enums, supports CommonJS, and enables tree-shaking optimizations.

**Breaking Changes**:
- Some enums have been removed. Use the string counterparts from related types:
  - `constants.ALIGN` --> `AlignValue` and `VAlignValue`
  - `constants.DIALECT` --> `DialectValue`
  - `constants.ARROW` --> `ArrowValue`
  - `constants.DIRECTION` --> `DirectionValue`
  - `constants.EDGESTYLE` --> `EdgeStyleValue`
  - `constants.ELBOW` --> `ElbowValue`
  - `constants.PERIMETER` --> `PerimeterValue`
  - `constants.RENDERING_HINT`: no replacement as it wasn't used
  - `constants.SHAPE` --> `ShapeValue`
  - `constants.TEXT_DIRECTION` --> `TextDirectionValue`
- The `constants.NODETYPE` enum has been removed and replaced by the `constants.NODE_TYPE` value object.
  The former `DOCUMENTTYPE` enum member has been renamed to `DOCUMENT_TYPE`.
- `constants.DIRECTION_MASK` is now read-only (types only).
- The `constants.FONT` enum has been removed and replaced by the `constants.FONT_STYLE_FLAG` value object.
- The `constants.CURSOR` enum has been removed. The values are now configurable and have been moved to:
  - `ConnectionHandler`
  - `EdgeHandlerConfig`
  - `HandleConfig`
  - `VertexHandlerConfig`
- All registries used to manage "styles" elements now derived from the `Registry` interface for consistency.
  So, they all share the same methods (add, get and clear) and their internal storage is no longer accessible.
- The `MarkerShape` registry has been renamed to `EdgeMarkerRegistry`.
- The Shapes are now registered in `ShapeRegistry` instead in `CellRenderer`.
- `StyleRegistry` has been removed. Use `EdgeStyleRegistry` and `PerimeterRegistry` instead.

## 0.19.0

Release date: `2025-04-30`

For more details, see the [0.19.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.19.0) on the GitHub release page.

This new version improves tree-shaking for `EdgeStyle` and `Perimeter`, updates the documentation, and fixes bugs.

**Breaking Changes**:
- `Perimeter` has been changed from a value object to a namespace. This has minimal impact for most applications that only read perimeter values.
  The only breaking change affects applications that modify Perimeter properties (add/update/remove values): this is no longer possible. Instead, create your own perimeter implementation and register it.
- `EdgeStyle` has been changed from a class with static properties to a namespace. This has minimal impact for most applications that only read edge style values.
  The breaking change only affects applications that modify EdgeStyle properties (add/update/remove values), which is no longer possible. Instead, create your own EdgeStyle implementation and register it.

## 0.18.0

Release date: `2025-04-26`

For more details, see the [0.18.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.18.0) on the GitHub release page.

This new version introduces `BaseGraph` for better control over loaded features, adds new utilities to register default style elements, and significantly reduces bundle size!

## 0.17.0

Release date: `2025-04-06`

For more details, see the [0.17.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.17.0) on the GitHub release page.

This new version improves graph fitting, makes i18n fully configurable, and reduces bundle size significantly.

**Breaking Changes**:
- `StylesheetCodec.allowEval` is now set to `false` by default to prevent unwanted use of the eval function, as it carries a possible security risk.
- `Utils.copyTextToClipboard` is no longer available. It was intended to be internal and had been made public by mistake.
- The built-in `Translations` class is no longer used by default. To use it, call `GlobalConfig.i18n = new TranslationsAsI18n()`
- Some functions are now accessible via a namespace:
  - `get`, `getAll`, `load`, `post`, `submit` via `requestUtils`
  - `error`, `popup` via `guiUtils`
- The `utils` namespace has been removed. The remaining properties associated to this namespace have been moved to the `guiUtils` namespace.
- The `cellArrayUtils.filterCells` function has been removed. Use the `Array.filter` function instead.

## 0.16.0

Release date: `2025-03-02`

For more details, see the [0.16.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.16.0) on the GitHub release page.

This new version enhances internationalization (i18n), improves connector configurations, and prepares for future updates with tree shaking optimizations.

**Breaking Changes**:
- The `utils.isNullish` and `utils.isNotNullish` functions are now marked as private.
They had been made public by mistake, and had been considered internal since their introduction.
- Some utility functions formerly used to retrieve default values for `CellStateStyle` and `CellStyle` properties, which were intended only for internal use, have been removed.
  - Use the [nullish coalescing operator (??)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing)
    and the [Optional chaining (?.)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) instead.
  - Removed functions:
    - `utils.getValue`
    - `stringUtils.getColor`
    - `stringUtils.getNumber`
    - `stringUtils.getStringValue`
- `Client.isBrowserSupported` has been removed. It didn't correctly validate all prerequisites required to know if the browser supports maxGraph.
So, remove it without replacement.
- `Client.VERSION` moved to `constants.VERSION`.
  - `VERSION` is supposed to be immutable as it represents the actual version of maxGraph.
  - When it was stored in `Client`, it was a static property that could be modified.
  - Moving it to the constants module ensures that it cannot be modified.
- All elements that were in `Client` to manage the configuration of `Translations` have moved to `TranslationsConfig`:
  - `Client.defaultLanguage` to `TranslationsConfig.getDefaultLanguage`
  - `Client.setDefaultLanguage` to `TranslationsConfig.setDefaultLanguage`
  - `Client.language` to `TranslationsConfig.getLanguage`
  - `Client.setLanguage` to `TranslationsConfig.setLanguage`
  - `Client.languages` to `TranslationsConfig.getLanguages`
  - `Client.setLanguages` to `TranslationsConfig.setLanguages`
- `ManhattanConnector` is now configured with the global `ManhattanConnectorConfig` object.
The following properties that were previously on `EdgeStyle` have moved to `ManhattanConnectorConfig`:
  - `MANHATTAN_END_DIRECTIONS` to `endDirections`
  - `MANHATTAN_MAX_ALLOWED_DIRECTION_CHANGE` to `maxAllowedDirectionChange`
  - `MANHATTAN_MAXIMUM_LOOPS` to `maxLoops`
  - `MANHATTAN_START_DIRECTIONS` to `startDirections`
  - `MANHATTAN_STEP` to `step`
- `OrthConnector` is now configured with the global `OrthogonalConnectorConfig` object.
The following properties that were previously on `EdgeStyle` have moved to `OrthogonalConnectorConfig`:
  - `orthBuffer` to `buffer`
  - `orthPointsFallback` to `pointsFallback`
- properties and utility methods previously exposed by `EdgeStyle` are now only internal.
  - The `getRoutePattern` method has been completely removed as it was not being used.
  - Nor was it used in the entire mxGraph and draw.io codebase.

## 0.15.1

Release date: `2025-02-13`

For more details, see the [0.15.1 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.15.1) on the GitHub release page.

This new version includes bug fixes and documentation improvements.

## 0.15.0

Release date: `2025-01-29`

For more details, see the [0.15.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.15.0) on the GitHub release page.

This new version offers more configuration options for edge handles (in particular, for virtual bends), and allows the "Entity Relation" connector to be globally configured.

**Breaking Changes**:
- Some properties have been removed from `EdgeHandler` as it was not possible to correctly change their value.
They are replaced by global configuration in `EdgeHandlerConfig`:
  - addEnabled --> addBendOnShiftClickEnabled
  - removeEnabled --> removeBendOnShiftClickEnabled
  - virtualBendOpacity
  - virtualBendsEnabled
- `domUtils.importNodeImplementation` has been removed:
  - This function was only used internally in `mxGraph` to support older versions of IE
  - It was not intended to be part of the public API
  - No migration steps are needed as the function was unused

## 0.14.0

Release date: `2024-11-27`

For more details, see the [0.14.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.14.0) on the GitHub release page.

This new version offers more configuration options for vertex and edge handles, and allows certain default style configurations to be globally replaced.

## 0.13.1

Release date: `2024-11-04`

For more details, see the [0.13.1 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.13.1) on the GitHub release page.

This release contains documentation improvements and bug fixes.

## 0.13.0

Release date: `2024-08-19`

For more details, see the [0.13.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.13.0) on the GitHub release page.

This new version improves the management of plugins and the overall documentation available in the website.

**Breaking Changes**
- In `Graph`, the properties related to the plugins are now private. This change should not impact users as these properties were not intended to be used directly.
Plugins are assumed to be initialized only by passing them to the `Graph` constructor and retrieved with the `getPlugin` method.

## 0.12.0

Release date: `2024-07-05`

For more details, see the [0.12.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.12.0) on the GitHub release page.

This release contains enhancements, documentation improvements and bug fixes.

**Breaking Changes**
- `VertexHandler.rotationEnabled` has been removed as it was not possible to correctly change its value.
Use `VertexHandlerConfig.rotationEnabled` to configure the rotation behavior globally or override the `VertexHandler.isRotationEnabled` method.

## 0.11.0

Release date: `2024-06-09`

For more details, see the [0.11.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.11.0) on the GitHub release page.

This release contains enhancements, documentation improvements and bug fixes.

**Breaking Changes**
- In `StencilShape`, the `allowEval` and `defaultLocalized` static properties have been removed. Configure these properties using `StencilShapeConfig`. 
- Logs are no longer sent to `MaxLog` by default. To restore the previous behavior, change maxGraph's global configuration with:
```js
GlobalConfig.logger = new MaxLogAsLogger();
```
- `MaxWindow.activeWindow` is no longer available; it was intended for internal use only, so there's no reason to make it public.
- The signature of `cellArrayUtils.getOpposites` has changed. It now returns an array and take an edges Cell array parameter.
Previously it was returning a function and this was an extra indirection. This is now simpler to use and match the signature of the mxGraph function.
- `cellArrayUtils.restoreClone` is no longer available. It was intended to be private.
- The signature of `cellArrayUtils.cloneCells` has changed. It now returns an array of Cells instead of a function. 
- The `GraphDataModel.cloneCell` function has been moved to the `cellArrayUtils` namespace. The function doesn't use any internal `GraphDataModel`
state, and moving it into `cellArrayUtils` is consistent with the `cloneCells` function already there.

## 0.10.3

Release date: `2024-05-29`

For more details, see the [0.10.3 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.10.3) on the GitHub release page.

This release contains bug fixes.

## 0.10.2

Release date: `2024-05-24`

For more details, see the [0.10.2 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.10.2) on the GitHub release page.

This release contains bug fixes.

## 0.10.1

Release date: `2024-04-23`

For more details, see the [0.10.1 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.10.1) on the GitHub release page.

This release contains documentation improvements and bug fixes.

## 0.10.0

Release date: `2024-04-19`

For more details, see the [0.10.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.10.0) on the GitHub release page.

This release contains enhancements, documentation improvements and bug fixes.

## 0.9.0

Release date: `2024-04-08`

For more details, see the [0.9.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.9.0) on the GitHub release page.

This release contains documentation improvements and bug fixes.

**Breaking Changes**
- it is no longer possible to pass a 'n' value for the `max` property of the `Multiplicity` class. Pass `null` instead to have the same effect.

## 0.8.0

Release date: `2024-02-14`

For more details, see the [0.8.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.8.0) on the GitHub release page.

This release contains new features and bug fixes.

**Breaking Changes**
They mainly impacts TypeScript users and impacts are limited:
- rename the `StyleArrayValue` type into `StyleArrowValue`.
This only has an impact on TypeScript users who use this type explicitly, which should happen rarely.
- `Perimeter` is no longer a class but a value object. This only impact users that had extended the
`Perimeter` class. Regular user that define perimeter style properties using function provided by
 `maxGraph` are not impacted by this change.
- `CellState.perimeter` no longer accept `Function`, but only the `PerimeterFunction`.
  - Passing an arbitrary `Function` was incorrect and always failed at runtime.
  - This change should not impact people using working implementation of perimeter function
  (including these provided by maxGraph) as they already have the right signature. Implementers of
  custom perimeter in TypeScript may have to slightly update their perimeter function declaration.
- `CellStateStyle.loopStyle` no longer accept `Function`, but only the `EdgeStyleFunction` (limited impacts like on the `perimeter` property) 
- `Graph.createEdgeHandler` only accepts `EdgeStyleFunction` for the `edgeStyle` parameter.
- `GraphView` signature method changes
  - `getPerimeterPoint` can now return `null`
  - `getPerimeterBounds` no longer accept null `CellState` and no longer returns `null`
- Some internal methods of `EdgeStyle` are no longer available:
  - `scaleCellState`
  - `scalePointArray`


## 0.7.0

Release date: `2024-01-20`

This release contains new features and bug fixes.

For more details, see the [0.7.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.7.0) on the GitHub release page.

## 0.6.0

Release date: `2023-12-22`

**Breaking Changes**
- Codecs supplied by `maxGraph` are no longer registered by default. They **MUST** be registered before performing an `encode` or `decode`.
You can use one of the following functions to register codecs: 
  - `registerAllCodecs`
  - `registerCoreCodecs`
  - `registerEditorCodecs`

To serialize the `maxGraph` model, you can use the `ModelXmlSerializer` class, which registers codecs under the hood.

For more details, see the [0.6.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.6.0) on the GitHub release page.

## 0.5.0

Release date: `2023-12-07`

## 0.3.0

Release date: `2023-07-07`

This release contains new features, bug fixes and documentation improvements.

**Breaking Changes**
- types: `Stylesheet.getDefaultVertexStyle` and `Stylesheet.getDefaultEdgeStyle` no longer return `undefined`.
- remove the `CellMap` type. It was not used in the maxGraph code, which should have no impact.

For more details, see the [0.3.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.3.0) on
the GitHub release page.

## 0.2.1

Release date: `2023-06-08`

This is a bug fix release.

## 0.2.0

Release date: `2023-05-22`

This release contains bug fixes and documentation improvements.

**Breaking Changes**:
  - helper functions involving _style in the string form_ have been removed from `styleUtils`. Styles are defined using
  the `CellStateStyle` and it is no longer necessary to process strings. For more details, see [PR #173](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/pull/173) and commit [5ecfda6](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/commit/5ecfda6b2b326c86597a3e3a6c4fb0548d3666b8).
  - some types related to `CellStateStyle` have been renamed. For more details, see [PR #165](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/pull/165) and commit [ca1914b](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/commit/ca1914b5824eed253556df585337aa07d974e920).
  - some properties of `CellStateStyle` have changed (removed or renamed). The renamed properties better match the former `mxGraph` properties. For more details, see [PR #165](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/pull/165) and commit [ca1914b](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/commit/ca1914b5824eed253556df585337aa07d974e920).

For more details, see the [0.2.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.2.0) on
the GitHub release page.

## 0.1.0

Release date: `2022-11-22`

Initial `mxGraph` implementation. This is an **alpha** version.

Starting from the mxGraph 4.2.2 release, we
- moved code to ES9
- removed Internet Explorer specific code
- migrated to TypeScript, based on the work initiated in [typed-mxgraph](https://github.com/typed-mxgraph/typed-mxgraph)
- migrated the examples to [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

For more details, see the [0.1.0 Changelog](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/releases/tag/v0.1.0) in the GitHub releases page.


## `mxGraph` Change Log
